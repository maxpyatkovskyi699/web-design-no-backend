## About the Project

**Chic & Charm** is a responsive beauty salon website that allows clients to explore services, book appointments online, leave reviews, and contact the administration. All functionality is implemented in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no backend — data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

The project includes the following features:

1. **Live clock** — real-time digital clock with auto-update
2. **Login / Logout** — user registration and authentication via modal windows
3. **Masters slider** — cyclic image slider showcasing salon staff
4. **Reviews** — customer review system with star ratings (1–5)
5. **Currency converter** — live UAH exchange rates via PrivatBank API
6. **Task manager** — internal tool for staff to create, track, and filter tasks
7. **Marketplace** — service catalogue with cart, quantity control, and order history
8. **Support** — contact form with JS validation for submitting issues to the administration

## Getting Started

The project requires no build step or backend. Simply open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash
# Option 1 — open the file directly
open index.html

# Option 2 — local server via VS Code (Live Server extension)
# or via Python:
python -m http.server 8000
# or
py -m http.server 8000
```

### ⚠️ API Notes

**Currency widget (PrivatBank API):** Requires the CORS proxy to be activated. Visit [cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) and click _"Request temporary access to the demo server"_ before using the converter.

**Weather widget (OpenWeatherMap API):** Make sure your API key is inserted into `js/weather.js`. Look for the `API_KEY` constant near the top of the file and replace the placeholder with your own key from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api).
